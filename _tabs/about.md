Hello, my name is Oleg.

With over 14 years of diverse experience spanning embedded systems, desktop applications, and server-side solutions, I've had the privilege of crafting a wide spectrum of commercial products.

From [industrial-grade telecommunication devices](https://infinetwireless.com/products/infilink-xg-1000) to [end-user Bluetooth &reg; audio products](https://global.beyerdynamic.com/free-byrd.html) and [IoT toys for children](https://tonies.com/en-eu/), my journey in software development has been both challenging and rewarding.

As a firm believer in the philosophy that "Good design, when it's done well, becomes invisible[^citation] ," I extend this principle to software in general. I aim to craft user experiences that flow effortlessly and feel intuitive, ensuring that the software seamlessly integrates into the overall product.

My mission is to assist companies in delivering products that just work, making my role virtually invisible to end-users.

Rather than vendor-locking my clients to obscure and complex implementations, I am dedicated to fostering their autonomy. My commitment lies in aiding companies to cultivate and retain in-house expertise, providing them with the knowledge and proficiency to independently navigate their technological landscape. I firmly believe that being open and sharing info is crucial for keeping strong, long-lasting business connections.

Furthermore, I have proficiency in designing hardware electronics, including schematic capture and PCB (Printed Circuit Board) development. A notable example is my Master's degree project, where I designed a custom PCB for an [Opus/MP3 portable music player](https://github.com/oleg-politechnik/walkgeek/wiki#n1100), carefully tailored to seamlessly fit within the compact dimensions of a Nokia 1100 case.

Additional references can be provided upon request.

I look forward to assisting you in finding solutions to your challenges, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.
